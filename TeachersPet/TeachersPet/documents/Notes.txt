By default, the Django template loader looks for templates in a nested structure within each app. 
The structure app/templates/accounts/home.html would be needed for a home.html template within the accounts app. 
But a single templates directory within teacherspet is cleaner and scales better . 
Let’s create a new templates directory and within it    a registration directory as that’s where Django will look for the log in template.


Put templates into TeachersPet\templates

Change settings.py

'DIRS': [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))],

Change homepage.html - point to template in new folder
